                <p>My favorite cartoon character is Cookie, and my favorite dessert is cupcakes. So Cookie Cupcakes are the best of both worlds. Did you know? Cookie character once said, “Sometimes I think what is love, and then I think love is what cookies is! But give up the last cookie for you... I wonder if the same applies for the cupcakes! If so, I don’t think I can ever love ANYONE!”</p>
